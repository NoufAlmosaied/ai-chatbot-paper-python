# Dataset Usage Report - Updated Configuration

## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Removed ZIP Files
- Deleted `Phishing Dataset for Machine Learning.zip`
- Deleted `Phishing Email Dataset.zip`
- Freed up disk space by removing redundant compressed files

### 2. Combined All Email Datasets
Created a unified dataset that includes ALL available CSV files:

| Original File | Samples | Included |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| phishing_email.csv | 82,486 | ✅ |
| CEAS_08.csv | 39,154 | ✅ |
| Enron.csv | 29,767 | ✅ |
| Nigerian_Fraud.csv | 3,332 | ✅ |
| SpamAssasin.csv | 5,809 | ✅ |
| Ling.csv | 2,859 | ✅ |
| Nazario.csv | 1,565 | ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | **164,972** | **All Combined** |

### 3. Dataset Statistics After Combination

- **Total Unique Samples**: 164,551 (after deduplication)
- **Phishing Emails**: 85,728 (52.1%)
- **Legitimate Emails**: 78,823 (47.9%)
- **Balance Ratio**: 1.09:1 (well-balanced)
- **Saved Location**: `data/processed/combined_email_dataset.csv`

### 4. URL Dataset (Separate)
- **File**: `Phishing_Legitimate_full.csv`
- **Samples**: 10,000 (5,000 phishing, 5,000 legitimate)
- **Features**: 48 pre-extracted URL features
- **Status**: Being used separately for URL-based analysis

## 📊 Total Data Available for Training

- **Email Samples**: 164,551
- **URL Samples**: 10,000
- **Combined Total**: 174,551 samples

## 🔄 Pipeline Updates

The preprocessing pipeline has been updated to:
1. Use the combined email dataset (`combined_email_dataset.csv`)
2. Process all available data instead of just `phishing_email.csv`
3. Maintain the URL dataset separately for feature analysis

## 📈 Improvement Over Previous Configuration

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Email Samples Used | 82,486 | 164,551 | +99.5% |
| Total Data Coverage | 53% | 100% | +47% |
| Dataset Diversity | 1 source | 7 sources | 7x |

## 🎯 Benefits of Using All Datasets

1. **Increased Training Data**: Nearly doubled the email samples (82K → 164K)
2. **Better Diversity**: Includes various phishing types (Nigerian scams, spam, corporate phishing)
3. **Improved Generalization**: Multiple data sources reduce overfitting
4. **Balanced Classes**: Natural 52/48 split between phishing and legitimate
5. **Real-World Representation**: Covers different time periods and attack styles

## 📝 How to Use the Combined Dataset

```python
# In your scripts, use:
df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/combined_email_dataset.csv')

# Or run the full pipeline:
python3 scripts/run_phase2_pipeline.py
```

## ✅ Verification

To verify all datasets are being used:
```bash
# Check combined dataset
wc -l data/processed/combined_email_dataset.csv
# Output: 164552 (including header)

# Run preprocessing on full dataset
python3 scripts/run_phase2_pipeline.py
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run the updated pipeline with all data
2. Train models on the expanded dataset
3. Compare performance with previous smaller dataset
4. Document improvements in accuracy
